title: "Communication with an IoT App"
---

There are several ways to communicate with an IoT app. Which method you need to use depends on your usecase, one of the biggest communication methods is to communicate with a Screen App you have running on the same device. This can, for example, integrate a barcode-scanner with the screen, or allow interaction with the screen to trigger a printer.

## Communication with screen and IoT apps

To communicate with a Screen or IoT app running on the same device, you can either send or receive messages. Let's have a look at how that works

### Receiving messages

To receive a message that is being sent from any application running on the same device you need to subscribe to the event.

```javascript
module.subscribe("event.name", async data => {})
```

This uses the event bus to listen to this specific event.

### Send messages

To send messages to any app running on the same device you need to publish an event on the message bus.

```javascript
module.publish("event.name", data => {})
```

#### App Side Communication
