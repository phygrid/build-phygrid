## üíª What Are Screen Apps?

Screen Apps are web-based applications that run across multiple platforms, including PhyOS VMs and devices, Tizen devices, and modern browsers. They provide a graphical user interface, delivering user-facing experiences that function as control panels or client interfaces for interacting with the Phygrid services and connected devices in your ecosystem.

Just like edge apps, screen apps are:

- Published and managed via your Phygrid tenant
- Deployed and configured using the Console
- Integrated with platform features, including:
  - App versioning
  - Settings schemas
  - Centralized configuration and content management
  - Real-time event collection via Signals

## üîß Common Use Cases for Screen Apps

Screen Apps are ideal for creating interactive user experiences and visual interfaces that connect to the Phygrid platform. Common applications include:

- Digital signage and content displays
- Interactive kiosks for customer engagement and self-service
- Product information displays with dynamic pricing
- Interactive wayfinding and directory systems
- Real-time dashboards displaying sensor data and device status
- Control interfaces for managing connected hardware and peripherals
- Queue management systems with live updates

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Screen Apps Work

- **Runtime:** Powered by modern browser engines across all supported platforms
- **Deployment:** Hosted and delivered by Phygrid's app hosting service
- **Flexible Stack:** Often built with React + TypeScript, though any modern web framework is supported
- **Offline Support:** Apps and media assets work offline on compatible platforms

Apps are tightly integrated into the Phygrid ecosystem, meaning:

- Updates and content management at scale through versioning
- Event-driven UI updates using Signals and peripheral twins

## üß∞ Prerequisites

Official Phygrid templates and examples use React with TypeScript, offering modern tooling, strong typing, and native SDK support. This is the stack we'll be working with throughout this tutorial.

Before you begin, make sure the following are set up and ready to go:

### ‚úÖ A Phygrid Tenant
You'll need access to a Phygrid tenant. If you don't yet have one, please refer to the [Tenant Setup](/getting-started/tenant-setup/) guide.

### ‚úÖ Local Development Environment with PhyCLI Installed and Configured

If you haven't set up CLI on your machine yet, refer to the [Dev Environment Setup](/getting-started/dev-environment-setup/) guide.

## üõ† Step-by-Step: Creating and Publishing a Screen App

Once your environment is ready, you can create and publish your first screen app. This process involves generating a starter project, building the app, and finally uploading the app to your tenant.

### 1. Scaffold the Screen App Project

Run the following command to begin:

```bash
phy app create
```

You'll be prompted to provide a name for your application. If you don't specify one via CLI args, you'll be asked interactively.

Then you'll select the app type - choose **‚ùØ Screen Application (React)**

You'll be asked if you want to create a device for emulation. Since we'll be setting up a device manually later in this tutorial, you can select "N" (or confirm the default, which is no).

### 2. Build, Push & Register the App

The CLI will now:

1. Pull the screen app boilerplate to your local machine
3. Build the boilerplate React project
4. Create and upload the app to your Phygrid tenant

Once complete, your app will be available in the Phygrid Console, ready to be installed and deployed to any capable device. We will cover this part later in the tutorial.

You can explore your newly created project. In the directory with the project, you will find:

- **React + TypeScript** project
- Inside the src directory:
  - `settings/index.json`: Contains the app's default settings for local development. You can customize these settings to suit your needs, but ensure they conform to the structure defined in schema.ts.
  - `schema.ts`: Settings schema for your application with example settings (to learn more about settings schemas, check this how-to guide)
  - `app.tsx`: Main React application component with example boilerplate logic
- Other files commonly found in React projects, like `package.json` containing useful scripts, `tsconfig.json`, and more

The `app.tsx` file demonstrates the usage of `@phygrid/hub-client` package for platform integration.

The initialization logic in this project is designed to work both locally and on devices:
- **Local development**: Uses local settings from `settings/index.json` for testing
- **Device deployment**: Connects to the Phygrid platform to receive real settings and establish communication 

The component also includes example initialization of Signals for event tracking. Signals are not covered in this tutorial, but you can learn more about them in our [dedicated Signals guide](/how-to/signals/).

### 3. Configure & Run App Locally

With your project now set up, you can run your screen application locally using the following command:

```bash
yarn run start
```

This runs a script that starts the development server with hot reloading enabled.

Then, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. Changes to your code will be reflected in real time, allowing you to develop with live updates.

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

After completing this process, you'll have:

- A working screen app project on your local machine built with React
- A new app available in your tenant for installation

## üöÄ Deploying the App to a PhyOS Device or VM

Now that your app is ready, the next step is to create an installation and deploy it to a browser, PhyOS VM or a physical PhyOS device.

### üì¶ Create an Installation

1. Log in to **console.phygrid.com**
2. Navigate to **Apps > Developer** and locate your app in the list
3. Press the **Install** button and provide a name for your new installation
4. After confirmation, you will be redirected to the **Installation** page
5. A build of your app will be created automatically as part of the installation


### üíª Connect a browser device

Browser devices provide a convenient way to test your screen app directly on your computer in an environment that simulates a real Phygrid device. This option is good for development and testing, but not intended for production deployments.

1. Navigate to the **Devices** tab on your Installation page
2. Press the **Connect a device** button
3. In the modal that appears, click **Setup a new device**
4. Select **Web Browser** as the device type
5. Open the browser URL, presented on the right
5. Enter:
   - A name for the device
   - The provisioning code displayed in the browser window
6. Confirm by pressing the **Connect device** button 

Once successfully connected, your app will load automatically in the browser window.

For additional details on connecting devices to installations, check out this [guide](https://learn.phygrid.com/installations/connect-a-new-device-to-an-installation/).

### üîå Connect a physical device

In this step, you can connect a physical device with a screen to your installation.

For an overview of supported device types, refer to our [Device Setup](../../../getting-started/device-setup) guide.

> If you don't have a physical device ready now, skip to the [**Connect a PhyVM**](#-connect-a-phyvm) section.

1. Navigate to the **Devices** tab on your Installation page
2. Press the **Connect a device** button
3. In the modal that appears, click **Setup a new device**
4. Choose your device type from the available options
5. Follow the setup instructions displayed on the right side of the modal
6. Enter:
   - A name for the device
   - The serial number or provisioning code shown on your device's screen
7. Confirm by pressing the **Connect device** button 

Once the device is successfully connected, you should see your app appear on the device screen shortly after.

If you run into issues at this stage, refer to the **[Debugging & Troubleshooting](/how-to/debugging-troubleshooting)** article of the documentation.

### üíª Connect a PhyVM

PhyVMs are a great option during development and for testing purposes. You can create a virtual PhyOS device using the Phy CLI. This is supported on macOS and Linux.

1. Run the following command:

```bash
phy app vm create
```

2. Provide a name for the VM (this is how you'll identify it later)
3. When prompted for VM architecture, confirm the default (host architecture)
4. Confirm:
   - Use of the latest PhyOS version
   - The default memory allocation

The CLI will now download the PhyOS image to your machine.

After the process is completed, a message will appear with the command to start your VM:

```bash
phy vm start <vm-name>
```

If dependencies are missing on your system, the CLI will prompt you to install them ‚Äî confirm and wait for setup to complete.

Once the VM is running, follow the same steps as in the physical device section to connect it to your installation. 
Select **x86-64** as the device type from the available options.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Make Code Changes

With your app now running locally and on the device, let's make some changes to see the development workflow in action.

Open `src/app.tsx` and update the code by adding an additional header element:

```ts
...
  return (
    <Container>
      <ProductInfo>
        <h1>Hello Phygrid!</h1> // <-- added
        <Logo src={logo} alt="logo" />
        <p>Product name: {productName}</p>
        <p>Product price: {productPrice}</p>
        <button onClick={onAddToCart}>Add to Cart</button>
      </ProductInfo>
    </Container>
  );
...
```

After saving your changes, the app will automatically update and reflect the changes in your local browser. If you closed the local development server, simply run `yarn start` again.

### üöÄ Publish an Updated Version

Once your app is updated and working as expected, it's time to publish a new version and deploy it via the Console.

1. Open your project in your IDE
2. In `package.json`, increase the version number:

```json
"version": "0.2.0"
```

3. Run the build script:

```bash
yarn build
```

This builds and generates a new `.gridapp` file ready to be published.

4. Publish the new version to your tenant:

```bash
yarn pub
```

### üß™ Test the New Version in Console

1. Go back to your installation in the Phygrid Console
2. Open the **Settings** tab and press **Edit settings**
3. Change the value of "Product name"
4. In the **Version** dropdown, select the latest version that you have pushed.
5. Press **Save all changes**

When you access the Settings tab of your installation, you'll see that the settings defined in your app's `schema.ts` appear in the Console as an editable form.

After a few moments, your app will be redeployed to connected devices with the new version.

You should now see the newly added "Hello Phygrid!" heading and the updated product name from your settings on both the device screen and the connected browser window.

## üéâ Success!

Your app is now running the updated version with modified code and updated settings.

You've successfully gone from creation to deployment, iteration, and production publishing ‚Äî all with full integration into the Phygrid platform.

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint

After completing this part of the tutorial, you should have:

- A functional screen app running on your connected browser and PhyOS device
- An installation configured in your tenant
