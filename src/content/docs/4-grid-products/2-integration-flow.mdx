To integrate with Grid Products, follow these steps to set everything up and start managing your data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have access to the [Phygrid Console](https://console.phygrid.com) and the following information:

1. **Tenant ID**  
   Found in the URL of your tenant after `organisations/`:  
   `https://console.omborigrid.com/organisations/{tenantId}`

2. **Environment ID**  
   Create this in the Grid Console under **<Terminal weight="fill" /> Operations &rarr; <Cloud weight="fill" /> Environments**. Examples might include `dev` or `staging`.

3. **Access Token**  
   Generate an access token in the **<SquaresFour weight="fill" />Apps &rarr; <Terminal weight="fill" />Developers** tab. You’ll need this for all API requests: [Products API](/grid-products/api?id=request-authentication), [Spaces API](/grid-products/spaces-api?id=request-authentication)

---

## Pushing Spaces

Spaces allow you to scope your data to specific locations or stores.

To create Spaces in the database, use the [Create Space endpoint](/grid-products/api?id=post-space). The `id` returned by this endpoint will be used later in `spaceIds` or `spaceId` fields when you format product data using the [GridProduct model](/grid-products/data-model?id=gridproduct).

---

## Pushing Product Types

Product types (or categories) organize your products for use in features like the Endless Aisle app. To create product types, use the [Push Product Types endpoint](/grid-products/api?id=post-push-product-types). Once set up, you can reference these types in the `productType` field of your products.

---

## Pushing Products

Now it’s time to push your products into the database. **You can do this in two ways:**

### **Option 1: Integrate via Backend**

Use our JavaScript NPM package to handle the integration directly in your backend. Follow the steps in the [Integration Setup](/grid-products/integration-flow?id=integration-setup) section to get started.

### **Option 2: Use the API**

For integrations from other systems, use our API and the [Push Products endpoint](/grid-products/api?id=post-push-products). You can also explore the API with our [Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/).

<InfoBox>
  **Tip:** After downloading the Postman collection, replace the `tenant-id` and
  `environment` values in your requests. Don’t forget to set the `x-api-key`
  header with your generated access token.

## Integration Setup

To integrate Grid Products into your applications, use the following NPM packages:

1. **React Frontend:** `@ombori/grid-products-client-react`

   Automatically handles parameters like `tenantId`, `environment`, and `dataResidency` for React applications.

   Hosted on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ombori/grid-products-client-react). **Install with npm or yarn:**

   ```bash
   npm i @ombori/grid-products-client-react
   yarn add @ombori/grid-products-client-react
   ```

2. **Backend or Other Frontends:** `@ombori/grid-products`

   Suitable for both backend and non-React frontend applications.

   Hosted on NPM. **Install with npm or yarn:**

   ```bash
   npm i @ombori/grid-products
   yarn add @ombori/grid-products
   ```

   ### Integrating into a Backend

   For backend integrations, use the GridProductServiceAdmin class to add, update, or remove products.

   ```javascript
   import { GridProductServiceAdmin } from "@ombori/grid-products"

   const gridProductAdmin = new GridProductServiceAdmin({
     tenantId: "your-tenant-id",
     environment: "staging",
     accessToken: "your-access-token",
     dataResidency: "EU",
   })

   const idsToRemove = ["ID1", "ID2", "ID3"]

   await gridProductAdmin.removeProducts(idsToRemove)
   ```

   Refer to the Push Products endpoint for details on API limitations and requirements.
