Grid Products is the service of Ombori that centralizes product data of clients that can be used within OmboriGrid and developed apps, for example in (Mobile) Endless Aisle or custom integration.

To understand how to integrate Grid Products, several documents can help you. But when you start fresh, it is recommended to check the [Integration Flow](/grid-products/integration-flow) first.

- [Integration Flow](/grid-products/integration-flow)
- [API Reference](/grid-products/api)
- [Data Models](/grid-products/data-model)

Each of these can also be found in the sidebar, as well as other complementary documents.
