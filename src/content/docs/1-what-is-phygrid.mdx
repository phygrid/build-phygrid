## 🚀 Designed for speed, scale, & simplicity

**Phygrid is the operating system for physical-world AI.**

We believe the next digital frontier isn't in the cloud. It's in the real world, where life happens. From intersections and warehouses to farmlands and ports, building for the physical world has been messy, fragmented, and slow. We're fixing it.

Phygrid is the infrastructure layer for real-world intelligence, turning edge devices into scalable systems, empowering developers to ship AI solutions in days, and making proof-of-concept to production a repeatable, capital-efficient playbook.

## ⚡️ What Phygrid solves

Phygrid solves the complexity of building real-world applications that run across edge devices, screens, sensors, and connected environments. Without stitching together fragile stacks or managing infrastructure manually. Whether you're orchestrating devices, collecting signals, integrating peripherals, or deploying AI at the edge, Phygrid handles the hard parts so you can focus on building.

### ✅ Set up and maintain edge devices

Use **PhyOS** to skip manual setup, driver mess, flaky updates, and unresponsive devices.

<PhyCard style={{ marginBottom: "var(--ant-margin-md)" }}>

💡 **Zero-Touch Provisioning & Remote Management:** Provision using a 6 digit code (like a chromecast) or using device serial numbers for provisioning multiple devices at scale. Manage devices via intuitive Web UI, secure shell access, or full Remote Desktop control.

🧠 **Hardware-Accelerated Container Runtime:** Native support for GPU-acceleration (Nvidia, AMD and Intel) for high-performance, low-latency applications and agentic workflows making decisions directly at the edge.

🖥️ **Cross-Platform Hardware Support:** Runs reliably on both Intel and ARM-based hardware, making it suitable for a wide range of embedded and commercial-grade computing devices.

🔄 **OTA Updates With Rollback:** Robust over-the-air update system with version control and rollback support to ensure safe and reliable updates in production environments.

🚨 **Operational Alerts:** Define alert conditions and recipient groups. Trigger based on connectivity, event sequences (or lack thereof) and alert different recipients depending on physical location.

</PhyCard>

### ✅ Manage devices at scale

At the heart of Phygrid is **Phyhub**. The high-performance, cloud-native Digital Twin backend that powers intelligent device orchestration, real-time communication, and secure remote control at scale.

<PhyCard style={{ marginBottom: "var(--ant-margin-md)" }}>

🧭 **Digital Twins:** Track and manage devices, apps, peripherals and physical spaces using digital twins for full visibility and control.

🔔 **Real-Time Messaging:** Facilitate low-latency communication between apps, devices & peripherals, both locally and across the cloud.

🔐 **Perform Secure, Full Remote Management:** Access logs, update configurations, restart services, and more. All remotely, securely, and instantly.

🧬 **Custom Descriptors:** Create descriptors for your bespoke digital twins to make your applications and agents understand and interact with your unique physical environment.

🧠 **Model Context Protocol:** By exposing all Phyhub digital twins using MCP, you enable agentic workflows across all your physical spaces.

</PhyCard>

### ✅ Deploy, monitor, and control from one place

Use the **Phygrid Console** to manage your entire environment through a single UI.

<PhyCard style={{ marginBottom: "var(--ant-margin-md)" }}>

🚀 **App Management:** Install your own applications or applications from the marketplace to a single or thousand devices. Set a global configuration and overrides per physical location or device.
