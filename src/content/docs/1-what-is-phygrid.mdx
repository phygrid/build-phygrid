## ⚡️ What Phygrid solves

Phygrid solves the complexity of building real-world applications that run across edge devices, screens, sensors, and connected environments. Without stitching together fragile stacks or managing infrastructure manually. Whether you're orchestrating devices, collecting signals, integrating peripherals, or deploying AI at the edge, Phygrid handles the hard parts so you can focus on building.

### ✅ Set up and maintain edge devices

Use **PhyOS** to skip manual setup, driver mess, flaky updates, and unresponsive devices.

<PhyCard style={{ marginBottom: "var(--ant-margin-md)" }}>

💡 **Zero-Touch Provisioning & Remote Management:** Provision using a 6 digit code (like a chromecast) or using device serial numbers for provisioning multiple devices at scale. Manage devices via intuitive Web UI, secure shell access, or full Remote Desktop control.

🧠 **Hardware-Accelerated Container Runtime:** Native support for GPU-acceleration (Nvidia, AMD and Intel) for high-performance, low-latency applications and agentic workflows making decisions directly at the edge.

🖥️ **Cross-Platform Hardware Support:** Runs reliably on both Intel and ARM-based hardware, making it suitable for a wide range of embedded and commercial-grade computing devices.

🔄 **OTA Updates With Rollback:** Robust over-the-air update system with version control and rollback support to ensure safe and reliable updates in production environments.

🚨 **Operational Alerts:** Define alert conditions and recipient groups. Trigger based on connectivity, event sequences (or lack thereof) and alert different recipients depending on physical location.

</PhyCard>

### ✅ Manage devices at scale

At the heart of Phygrid is **Phyhub**. The high-performance, cloud-native Digital Twin backend that powers intelligent device orchestration, real-time communication, and secure remote control at scale.

<PhyCard style={{ marginBottom: "var(--ant-margin-md)" }}>
