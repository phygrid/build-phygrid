## What is Phygrid?

**The operating system for physical-world AI.**

Run apps and AI at the edge, stream data, manage devices, and build interactive real-world experiences. From warehouses to streets we make edge + cloud + AI work together, at scale.

## 🧱 Why build on Phygrid?

Traditional IoT stacks are fragmented. AI at the edge is messy.

**We fix that with:**

1. ✅ Edge-native OS (PhyOS) with OTA + GPU
2. ✅ Digital twins + MCP for real-world context
3. ✅ One CLI, API, and Console to manage it all
4. ✅ Built-in MLOps + signals + remote ops
5. ✅ Secure, compliant, multi-region data

## 🔍 Core concepts

Phygrid is everything you need to build for the real world. As easily as you build for the web.

**PhyOS** runs on Intel, ARM, or custom hardware. It’s a secure, GPU-accelerated container OS with OTA updates and built-in failover. Perfect for edge AI, high-performance logic, and hardware control.

**Phyhub** is your cloud-native backend. It manages digital twins, streams real-time data, powers ML pipelines, and handles everything from identity to products, checkout, and media.

**Signals** track every event, drive analytics, and fine-tune your models. Spaces map your environment from region to room, so you can target content, apply permissions, and generate rich reporting.

**Peripherals** — doors, cameras, printers, sensors — all become controllable through simple APIs and digital twin models. Your apps interact with them just like software objects.

And it's all tied together by a **complete toolkit for developers**: use the CLI, REST API, drop-in SDKs, the intuitive Console UI, or connect agentic workflows via the MCP server.

## ⚡️ Quickstart for developers

Build your first edge app in **less than 10 minutes:**

Want the full walkthrough? 👉 Check out the complete [Edge App tutorial](../tutorials/build-your-first-edge-app).

```bash
# Scaffold your edge app
phy app create

# Deploy to a local VM for testing (or connect a device)
phy app vm create
phy vm start <vm-name>

# Push and register your app
phy app deploy

# Connect to your device or VM shell
phy dev shell <device-name>

# Check your container
docker ps
docker logs <container-id> -f

```

From here, you can iterate, publish new versions, and deploy at scale. All from the CLI or Console.

## 🧠 Edge AI Marketplace

1. **Deploy from Hugging Face with one command.** Go from prototype to live edge inference in minutes.
2. **Fine-tune, run inference, and stream analytics.** Manage your entire model lifecycle right from Phygrid.
3. **CLI and SDK support.** Automate deployments, scaffold apps, upload models, and bind to devices with Node or Python.
4. **Roll out to thousands of devices.** Phygrid handles orchestration, health checks, rollbacks, and fleet scaling.
5. **Build adaptive edge apps.** Use MCP to make your models environment-aware and responsive to real-world signals.
6. **Install and manage via Console or CLI.** Keep full control over where and how your apps run.

## 🔒 Data, security & compliance

1. End-to-end encrypted. Data is secure in transit and at rest (WSS, HTTPS).
2. Anonymized user IDs. Easy consent management and withdrawals.
3. Global data residency. Choose where your data lives: EU, US, AU, IN, UAE.
4. Signed containers with RBAC. Secure deployments and role-based access.
5. CLI and SDK level control. Encrypt, deploy, and audit with Node and Python.
6. ISO 27001 & 27701 certified. Enterprise-grade security and privacy.
7. Firewall and threat detection. Azure WAF, IDPS, and Sentinel SIEM.
8. Outbound-only networking. One port to whitelist, secure by default.

## 🥇 Why developers love Phygrid

No one else combines edge-native GPUs, OTA rollback, digital twins, live ML ops, and app UX in a single platform.
