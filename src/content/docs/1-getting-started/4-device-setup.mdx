> **Note:** AI models with hardware acceleration are supported on physical devices that have CUDA-compatible GPUs available.

## 💡 Choosing the Right Device

**For Production:**
- **Physical devices** for maximum control and performance
- **Enterprise virtualization** for cloud-native edge deployments
- **Samsung Tizen TVs** for digital signage and display scenarios

**For Development:**
- **PhyVM** for local development with full app support
- **Web Browser** for quick screen app prototyping and testing

**For AI Workloads:**
- **x86-64 with CUDA GPU** for hardware-accelerated AI model inference
- **Virtual platforms** for AI workloads that don't require GPU acceleration


## 🖥️ Physical Devices

### 🖥 Intel x86-64 and ARM-based Hardware

Intel devices and ARM-based Giada DN74 are ideal for production deployments where you need full control and maximum performance. With PhyOS installed, they become completely managed Phygrid devices with:

- **Full app support** — Both edge apps and screen apps when a display is connected
- **Versatile deployment** — Use as edge computing devices, interactive kiosks, or complete user experiences
- **Hardware acceleration** — Devices with CUDA-compatible GPUs can run AI models with hardware acceleration
- **Production ready** — Suitable for on-site, enterprise deployments

### 📺 Samsung Tizen TVs

Samsung Tizen TVs support screen apps and are perfect for digital signage scenarios:

- **Supported versions** — Tizen 4, 6.5, and 7
- **Use cases** — Digital signage, information displays, content delivery
- **Limitations** — Screen apps only; don't offer the same level of control as PhyOS-compatible devices

You can learn more about [Tizen device support](https://learn.phygrid.com/installations/connect-a-tizen-device-to-an-installation/) on learn.phygrid.com.

## ☁️ Virtual Devices

Virtual environments provide flexibility for development, testing, and cloud deployments.

### 🏢 Enterprise Virtualization

Production-ready virtualization platforms support edge apps in headless environments:

- **VMware x86-64** — Enterprise virtualization for edge computing workloads
- **Hyper-V x86-64** — Microsoft's virtualization platform for Windows environments  
- **Red Hat KVM** — Open-source virtualization for Linux-based infrastructure

These platforms are ideal for running edge apps in environments where deploying physical devices isn't possible or desired.

### 🛠 Development Platforms

For development and testing, these virtual options provide easy setup and iteration:

- **PhyVM** — PhyVMs, created and managed using PhyCLI, are a great option during development and for testing purposes
- **Web Browser** — Quick testing environment for screen apps only

## 🚀 Getting Started - Setup A Device

For detailed device setup instructions, visit [learn.phygrid.com](https://learn.phygrid.com/installations/connect-a-new-device-to-an-installation/) and follow the guided setup in the Phygrid Console when connecting a device to an installation.

PhyVMs are integrated into the development workflow and managed using PhyCLI. You will learn more about creating and using PhyVMs in our [edge app](../../tutorials/build-your-first-edge-app) and [screen app](../../tutorials/build-your-first-screen-app) tutorials.
For more details, refer to CLI reference documentation.
