Your Phygrid tenant is your organization's dedicated workspace in the Phygrid platform where you'll manage all aspects of your edge computing ecosystem, including devices, apps, installations, and analytics.

Once your tenant is set up, you'll be able to access the Phygrid Console, use the Phygrid CLI, and start building.

> **Note:** We're currently developing a new, streamlined self-signup and onboarding experience that will be available soon. Temporarily, tenant creation is handled through our support team.
