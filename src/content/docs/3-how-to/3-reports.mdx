This comprehensive guide demonstrates how to configure and customize analytics dashboards and reports for your PhyStack applications. You'll learn how to set up analytics schemas, track custom events, and visualize data across multiple organizational levels.

**After completing this guide, you should understand:**

- How to configure analytics schemas for your Screen Apps
- The four levels of report aggregation available in the platform
- How to implement custom event tracking for business metrics
- Best practices for creating meaningful analytics dashboards
- How to visualize custom events in the Console's reporting interface

## **⚙️ What Are Reports?**

Reports and analytics provide valuable insights into user interactions, app performance, and business metrics. By implementing custom analytics schemas, you can track specific events relevant to your use case and display meaningful data visualizations in the PhyStack Console.

## 🛠️ How to Implement Analytics

This section demonstrates how to create reports for [signals](/how-to/signals/) using a product rating system as an example.
You'll learn how to create user interface elements, emit events, and configure analytics to display the tracked data.

### **Screen App Analytics Example**

If you don't have a screen app project yet, you can create one by following the [Build your first screen app](/tutorials/build-your-first-screen-app/) tutorial.
All new Screen Apps and Edge Apps include a basic analytics schema located in `src/analytics-schema.ts`. The **analytics schema** defines the structure and types of data visualizations displayed in your application's dashboard. Screen Apps include
a default analytics schema that can be customized to track specific events and metrics relevant to your business needs. The default configuration provides session tracking:

```ts
const analyticsSchema: AnalyticsSchema = {
  groups: [
    {
      name: "Overview",
      cards: [
        {
          type: CardType.Sessions,
          interactionType: SessionInteractionType.Interactive,
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

### **Step 1: Create User Interface Components**

First, implement the UI components that will collect user input and trigger custom events. Add the following state management and event handler to your Screen App:

```ts
const [selectedRating, setSelectedRating] = useState<1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5>(5)

const handleSendRating = useCallback(() => {
  const { signals } = state
  if (!signals) return

  signals.sendRating({
    rating: selectedRating,
  })
}, [state, selectedRating])
```

**Key Components:**

- **State Management:** Track user's selected rating value
- **Event Handler:** Emit custom events when ratings are submitted
- **Signals Integration:** Use the signals client to send events to the platform

### **Step 2: Add Rating Interface Elements**

Include the rating user interface in your app's main component by adding the following JSX elements:

```tsx
<RatingSection>
  <p>Rate this product:</p>
  <StarRating>
    {([1, 2, 3, 4, 5] as const).map(star => (
      <Star
        key={star}
        filled={star <= selectedRating}
        onClick={() => setSelectedRating(star)}
      >
        ★
      </Star>
    ))}
  </StarRating>
  <StyledButton onClick={handleSendRating}>
    Send Rating ({selectedRating} star)
  </StyledButton>
</RatingSection>
```

### **Step 3: Apply Custom Styling**

Add the following styled components to create a polished user interface:

```ts
const RatingSection = styled.div`
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  margin-top: 20px;
`

const StarRating = styled.div`
  display: flex;
  gap: 5px;
  margin: 10px 0;
`

const Star = styled.span<{ filled: boolean }>`
  font-size: 30px;
  color: ${props => (props.filled ? "#FFD700" : "#555")};
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: color 0.2s ease;
  user-select: none;

  &:hover {
    color: #ffd700;
  }
`
```

### **Step 4: Configure Analytics Schema**

Update your `analytics-schema.ts` file to include the custom event tracking configuration:

```ts
const analyticsSchema: AnalyticsSchema = {
  groups: [
    {
      name: "Overview",
      cards: [
        {
          type: CardType.Sessions,
          interactionType: SessionInteractionType.Interactive,
        },
        {
          type: CardType.EventsCount,
          title: "Ratings Submitted",
          eventType: "RATING",
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

**Configuration Details:**

- **Event Counting:** Track the total number of rating submissions
- **Custom Title:** Display meaningful labels in the dashboard
- **Event Type Filtering:** Specify which events to include in the visualization

### **Step 5: Deploy and Test**

After implementing the custom event tracking, follow these steps to deploy and validate your changes:

1. **Build the Updated App:**

   ```bash
   phy app build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Your Tenant:**

   ```bash
   phy app publish
   ```

3. **Test the Rating Interface:**
   - Navigate to your deployed Screen App
   - Interact with the rating interface to generate events
   - Verify that ratings are submitted successfully

![Rating Interface](../../../images/3-reports/screen-app-rating-select.png)

4. **Monitor Analytics Dashboard:**
   - Allow 24 hours for analytics processing
   - Check the Console for updated dashboard metrics
   - Verify that rating events appear in the reports

![Updated Analytics Dashboard](../../../images/3-reports/installation-level-report-with-rating.png)

**Expected Results:**

- Rating interface appears and functions correctly on the device
- User interactions generate custom events that are tracked
- Analytics dashboard displays the new "Ratings Submitted" metric

**Note:** Analytics will appear after 24 hours
