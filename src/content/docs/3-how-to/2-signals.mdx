This comprehensive guide explains how to implement and utilize signals in the Phygrid platform to collect data from interaction points, track user behavior,
and monitor application performance. Signals provide real-time comprehensive analytics and monitoring capabilities.

## **📊 What Are Signals**

Signals are the foundation of data collection, alerts and analytics in the Phygrid platform. They enable insights into user interactions,
application performance, and custom analytics. The data collected through signals is processed by the Phygrid platform and presented in the console's analytics dashboards.

## **🚀 Getting Started with Signals**

The `@phygrid/hub-client` package provides a comprehensive and robust API for initializing and utilizing signals in your applications.
This powerful toolkit enables you to seamlessly integrate analytics, user behavior tracking, and application monitoring into your
Phygrid applications. This section provides a detailed walkthrough of the setup process and demonstrates proven implementation
patterns used in production environments.

### **📱 Signals With Screen App Example**

If you don't have a screen app project yet, you can create one by following the [Build your first screen app](/tutorials/build-your-first-screen-app/) tutorial.

Signals are automatically pre-configured and ready to use when you create applications using the Phygrid
screen app template, providing immediate out-of-the-box analytics
capabilities. The hub-client library exposes a dedicated `initializeSignals()` method that handles the complete setup
process.

When you create a new application using the Phygrid template, you'll find the signals initialization process already
implemented in your main `App.tsx` component. This initialization pattern ensures that signals are properly configured
before your application begins collecting user interaction data and performance metrics:

```typescript
const initializeClient = useCallback(async () => {
  try {
    const client = await connectPhyClient()
    const signals = await client.initializeSignals() // <----- signals initialization
    const settings = (await client.getSettings()) as Settings

    setState({ client, settings, signals })
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error initializing client:", err)
  }
}, [])
```

`initializeSignals()` automatically initializes client and session by fetching the device and app details from PhyOS and returns an object that can be used to send standard or custom events. In `App.tsx` you will also find how a standard signal **sendCartAdd** is generated:

```typescript
signals.sendCartAdd({ productId: "TEMPORARY-PRODUCT-ID-123", quantity: 1 })
```

**Note:** You can read more about how the generated signals can be visualized in Console in the reports guide.

### **📈 Advanced Initialization Process**

When implementing signals within a screen app or edge app deployed on a Phygrid device running on PhyOS, all required initialization parameters are automatically retrieved from the device and app configuration. For scenarios where signals are implemented in standalone scripts or applications running outside of the Phygrid device environment, manual parameter configuration is required to establish proper signal initialization.

```typescript
import { connectPhyClient } from "@phygrid/hub-client"

const initParams = {
  deviceId: "device-12345",
  installationId: "install-67890",
  spaceId: "space-abcdef",
  tenantId: "tenant-xyz",
  appVersion: "1.0.0",
  appId: "com.example.app",
  environment: "production",
  dataResidency: "EU",
  country: "SE",
  installationVersion: "2.3.4",
  accessToken: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR...",
  clientUserAgent: "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)",
  ip: "192.168.1.100",
}

const client = await connectPhyClient()
const signals = await client.initializeSignals(initParams)
```

## **📡 Signal Types**

The Phygrid platform supports three distinct types of signals, each serving specific purposes and providing different levels of insight into your application's performance and user behavior.

#### **1. Event Signals**

Event signals are the most versatile and commonly used signal type. They capture specific user interactions and application events, providing detailed insights into user behavior and application functionality.

**When generated:** Manually triggered by your application code

**Data captured:**

- Event type and category
- User interaction details
- Product or content information
- Transaction data
- Custom parameters

**Example use cases:**

- Track user searches and navigation patterns
- Monitor e-commerce transactions and conversions
- Capture user feedback and ratings
- Track application errors and performance issues
- Monitor specific business processes

#### **2. Session Signals**

Session signals track the lifecycle of application sessions, providing comprehensive insights into application usage patterns and user engagement. Events are tied to sessions, which helps in aggregating data for analytics and provides context for user behavior analysis. Sessions are generated automatically when you initialize signals by calling `initializeSignals()`.

**When generated:** Automatically generated when `initializeSignals()` is called

#### **3. Client Signals**

Client signals capture essential information about the clients connecting to your application. Sessions are tied to clients and store necessary information about the client, such as IP address, device characteristics, and browser details. Client signals are also generated automatically upon the initialization of signals when `initializeSignals()` is invoked.

**When generated:** Automatically generated when `initializeSignals()` is called and client is connected

## **🎯 Common Use Cases**

Signals can be implemented across various scenarios to enhance your application's analytics and monitoring capabilities:

### **E-commerce Applications**
