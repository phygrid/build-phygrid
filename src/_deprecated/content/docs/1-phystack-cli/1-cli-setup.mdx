You will need following prerequisites in your dev environment for PhyStack CLI to work:

- [NodeJS 20](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Git CLI

## Install CLI

To install the CLI, you have to download the `@phystack/cli` package from NPM. This package should be installed globally.

```bash
npm i -g @phystack/cli
```

## Authentication

Authentication with the CLI works using Device Grant Flow.

Then to authenticate the CLI run the following command:

```bash
phy login
```

A special command can be used when you need to use the phy CLI on environment without a browser:

```
phy login --use-device-code
```

## Confirm successful authentication

Verify the setup by running a command that lists your tenants:

```bash
phy tenant list
```

If you see your tenant's name and you don't see any errors, you are good to go!
