# Ensure Project Follows Standard Configurations

1. **Code Style Consistency**
   - Enforce `.editorconfig` settings (2 spaces, LF, UTF-8).
   - No trailing whitespace or mixed line endings.

2. **Linting & Formatting**
   - ESLint rules must be followed across all TypeScript files.
   - Prettier must auto-format code before commits.

3. **Yarn-Only Policy**
   - `package-lock.json` must not exist.
   - All dependencies must be installed via Yarn.
